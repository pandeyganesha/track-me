# Which Lang To use

I need to decide which language I should use to track my activities.
And I am suggested (by GPT) to use RUST. Because I might need to deal with low level or OS level stuff for which RUST is more preferred than python.

## How Do I start
First of all I don't know anything about RUST. I will learn it on the fly.

Rust is little different than other languages as it implements so many different things ranging from C like struct to functional languages' paradigms. So I have learnt basics of it by solving some easy DSA questions and watching some basic lectures just so that I can understand my ( or copied code ).

Followed this channel to learn basics of Rust

## Structure I have decided to follow

1. First we will write a Rust code to listen to the socket and read streams.
1. Parse the stream output into required Data Structures
1. Store data in memory and for now write into some file to keep data.
1. As per requirements, when we need to ask questions about data, we might want to use some simple database. But simple files suffice for now.
